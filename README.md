# Life Savers Project

The Life Savers CPR App is used to guide and inform users about the uses and instructions for CPR (Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation). The app has instructions and visuals to help people learn about AED (Automatic External Defibrillator) usage, Naloxone (reverses effects of an opioid overdose) administration, and child, adult, and infant CPR. With a professional and efficient interface, the app assists users whether in learning or emergency situations.
